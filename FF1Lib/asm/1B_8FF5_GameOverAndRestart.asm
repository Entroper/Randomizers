;;	Saves game progress and sets the player's overworld map
;;	position to the last inn / overworld location they saved
;;	at.  This is mostly a copy of code elsewhere, except it
;;	does not update the player's map coordinates/vehicle.
;;	This also does the closing animation of fading out the
;;	Combat boxes since we have to replace a JSR in new
;;	GameOver.
;;	Certain game flags will need to be reset under particular
;;	conditions.  Particularly, this means that Garland,
;;	Bikke, Astos, Vampire, and the four fiends - map objects
;;	which trigger a fight - must be reset if particular
;;	conditions are not set.  These conditions are:
;;	Garland: If did not talk to the princess (princess 1 in
;;	tof is visible), Garland is reset to visible.
;;	Bikke (no NPC shuffle): If the terrified townsfolk are
;;	not visible, Bikke's flag to indicate that he has been
;;	fought is reset.
;;	Bikke (NPC shuffle): If the event flag for bikke is not
;;	1, then the terrified townsfolk are turned to invisible.
;;	Astos: The NPC code for Astos is changed
;;	to function like Bikke (see additional code).  A bat in
;;	Astos' castle is set to turn on visibility if Astos is
;;	defeated.  If this bat is not visible, then Astos'
;;	event flag is reset.
;;	Vampire: If the chest Vampire is guarding is not open,
;;	then Vampire's visibility is reset.  This does mean that
;;	if the chest is not picked up because of inventory space
;;	then Vampire will respawn (and if Early Sarda is off,
;;	you are in for a rude awakening).
;;	Earth/Fire/Water/Air orb: If the appropriate orb is not
;;	in the player's inventory, then the visibility flag for
;;	the the fiend fights is turned back on.
;;	Garland 1/2/3 (the version you encounter in ToFR) will
;;	always be reset to their default values as if you never
;;	entered the room.
